## Steam Mover
Manage games from your Steam libraries – backup games, or move them from your HDD to your SSD, et cetera. Featuring:

* Visualisation – see how much of what drive is taken up by your games
* Toolkit – launch a game, browse its files, verify its cache, look at its store page and more
* Library finder – autodetects Steam config to show libraries, and finds libary given vague paths

Also comes with `sm.py`, a rudimental Steam library API, with class `Operation` that copies one folder to another with status-giving callback.
