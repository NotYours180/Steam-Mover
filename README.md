## Steam Mover
*Steam library manager for Python 3*

Manage games from your Steam libraries – backup games, move them from your HDD to your SSD, visualise which game takes up the most space, et cetera. Featuring:

* Visualisation – see how much of what drive is taken up by your games
* Toolkit – launch a game, browse its files, verify its cache, look at its store page and more
* Library finder – automagically detects your Steam libraries, finds a library given vague paths, or searches drives for libraries

Includes `Operation` class, for large-scale copy operations with status-keeping.

### Usage

To run, simply put both .py files into a folder and run `Steammover.py`. (The program is designed for Python 3.4 or newer, but may work on older versions.)

SM should automatically detect your library paths – type a path in the respective entry to change it. (You don't have to be ultra-precise in the path!) Double-click a game to select it, and click one of the fancy buttons to do an action. Simplicity itself!
